## Overview

This script allows you to scrape the web for the latest cyber security news and send it to a specified Telegram channel using a Telegram bot. The script performs a Google News search for "cybersecurity" and retrieves news articles from the current day. It then shortens the article links and sends each article's title and shortened link to the Telegram channel.

## Prerequisites

To run the script, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- `beautifulsoup4` library (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
- `pyshorteners` library (`pip install pyshorteners`)
- `python-telegram-bot` library (`pip install python-telegram-bot`)
- `nest-asyncio` library (`pip install nest-asyncio`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NAQQAD/cyber-security-news-bot.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Obtain a Telegram Bot API token:

  - Go to BotFather on Telegram.
  - Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on the "Start" button.
  - Type /newbot and follow the instructions to create a new bot.
  - Choose a name for your bot (e.g., "CyberSleuthBot") and a unique username (e.g., "@cyber_sleuth_bot").
  - After successfully creating the bot, BotFather will provide you with an API token. Copy this token as you'll need it later.

4. Configure the Telegram Bot API token:

  - Open the CyberSleuthBot.py file in a text editor.
  - Find the line bot = Bot(token='YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN').
  - Replace 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN' with the API token obtained from BotFather. The line should look like: bot = Bot(token='your_token_here')

5. Customize the script (optional):

  - You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following:
  - Telegram Channel: Change the chat_id parameter in the line await bot.send_message(chat_id='@Cyber0xSleuth', text=message) in the telegram_bot.py script. Replace @Cyber0xSleuth with your desired Telegram channel username or ID.
  - Search Query: If you want to change the search query from "cybersecurity" to something else, modify the URL in the send_cybersecurity_news() function in the news_scraper.py script.

6. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python CyberSleuthBot.py
   ```
